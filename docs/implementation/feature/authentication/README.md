# Authentication Feature Implementation

> ⚠️ **AUDITED 2025-10-17**: This document reflects **ACTUAL** implementation status.

## 📊 Overall Progress: 0% (0/5 screens) ❌

### 🚨 REALITY CHECK
**NO authentication implementation exists. Previously documented as 20% - this was INCORRECT.**

- ❌ NO Login screen exists (mobile or desktop)
- ❌ NO AuthContext implemented
- ❌ NO authentication logic exists

## 🔐 Screen Status (CORRECTED)

| Screen | Figma Node | Mobile | Desktop | API | Tests | Priority |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|-----|-------|----------|
| **Login** | 6804-13742 | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | 🔴 Critical |
| **Register** | - | ⏸️ Pending | ⏸️ Pending | ❌ | ❌ | 🟡 High |
| **Forgot Password** | - | ⏸️ Pending | ⏸️ Pending | ❌ | ❌ | 🟢 Medium |
| **Reset Password** | - | ⏸️ Pending | ⏸️ Pending | ❌ | ❌ | 🟢 Medium |
| **Profile** | - | ⏸️ Pending | ⏸️ Pending | ❌ | ❌ | 🔵 Low |

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

| Component | Status | File | Description |
|-----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **AuthContext** | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | `packages/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (doesn't exist) | Global auth state |
| **MockAuthService** | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | `packages/services/mockAuth.ts` (doesn't exist) | Simulated auth API |
| **TokenManager** | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | `packages/utils/tokenManager.ts` (doesn't exist) | JWT handling |
| **SessionStorage** | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | `packages/utils/session.ts` (doesn't exist) | Persist session |
| **AuthGuard** | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | `packages/components/AuthGuard.tsx` (doesn't exist) | Route protection |

## 📱 Login Screen Implementation

### Current Status (CORRECTED)
- [ ] ❌ **NO Login screen exists** (previously marked as "basic structure" - INCORRECT)
- [ ] Email input field
- [ ] Password input field
- [ ] Remember me checkbox
- [ ] Submit button
- [ ] Form validation
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Forgot password link
- [ ] Register link
- [ ] Social login buttons
- [ ] Biometric auth (mobile)

### Files
- Mobile: `apps/mobile/src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx`
- Desktop: `apps/desktop/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`
- Shared Logic: `packages/features/auth/useLogin.ts`

### Figma Design
- [Login Screen](https://www.figma.com/design/xFC8eCJcSwB9EyicTmDJ7w/I.R.I.S.-Prototype?node-id=6804-13742)

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

```
1. User enters credentials
   ↓
2. Validate input locally
   ↓
3. Call MockAuthService.login()
   ↓
4. Receive mock token & user data
   ↓
5. Store in AuthContext
   ↓
6. Persist to AsyncStorage/localStorage
   ↓
7. Navigate to Dashboard
```

## 🛡️ Security Features (Planned)

- [ ] Password strength indicator
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID)
- [ ] Session timeout
- [ ] Refresh token rotation
- [ ] Rate limiting (mock)
- [ ] CAPTCHA for multiple failed attempts

## 📦 Dependencies

```json
{
  "react-hook-form": "^7.48.0",
  "yup": "^1.3.0",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.19.0",
  "react-native-keychain": "^8.1.0"
}
```

## ⚠️ AUDIT NOTES

**Audit Date**: 2025-10-17
**Finding**: Authentication documentation was aspirational, not factual

### What Was Wrong:
- ❌ Claimed 20% progress (1/5 screens) → **ACTUAL: 0% (0/5 screens)**
- ❌ Login marked as "Basic structure" → **ACTUAL: File doesn't exist**
- ❌ No files were created for authentication system

### What Needs to Happen:
1. Create `packages/contexts/` directory for AuthContext
2. Create `packages/services/` for mock authentication
3. Implement Login screen (mobile + desktop)
4. Setup form validation (react-hook-form + yup)
5. Add session persistence (AsyncStorage/localStorage)
6. Implement route guards

### Estimated Timeline:
- AuthContext + MockService: 1 day
- Login screen (mobile): 1 day
- Login screen (desktop): 1 day
- Form validation + error handling: 1 day
- Remaining 4 screens: 3 days
- **Total: ~7 days**
