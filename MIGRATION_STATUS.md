## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Testing & Validation (30min - 1 hour)
1. Test mobile app: `npm run mobile:android`
2. Verify Bluetooth connectivity
3. Test streaming functionality
4. Verify auto-scroll works
5. Ensure shared types function correctly

### Phase 2: Extract Middleware (2-3 hours)
1. Create `packages/middleware/`
2. Extract Bluetooth protocol encoder/decoder
3. Extract stream data processor
4. Update both apps to use middleware

### Phase 3: Desktop App Features (Ongoing)
1. Implement data import functionality
2. Implement visualization features
3. Add report generation
4. Integrate with Research Node API
