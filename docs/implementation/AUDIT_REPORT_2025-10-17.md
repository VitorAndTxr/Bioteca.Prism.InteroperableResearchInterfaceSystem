# IRIS Implementation Audit Report

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Auditor**: Claude Code (AI Assistant)
**Method**: Complete filesystem scan + code verification
**Scope**: All implementation claims vs actual codebase

---

## Executive Summary

This audit was conducted to verify the accuracy of implementation documentation against the actual codebase. **Significant discrepancies were found** between documented progress and actual implementation.

### Key Findings

| Category | Documented | **Actual** | Variance |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Overall Progress** | 22% | **12%** | -45% error |
| **Design System** | 10% (3/30) | **0%** (0/30) | -100% error |
| **Authentication** | 20% (1/5) | **0%** (0/5) | -100% error |
| **Test Coverage** | 15% | **0%** | -100% error |

**Conclusion**: Documentation was aspirational rather than factual. Real progress is significantly lower than documented.

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Design System - MAJOR DISCREPANCY ❌

**Documented Status**: 10% complete (3/30 components)
- ✅ SEMGChart (completed)
- 🚧 Button (in progress)
- ⏸️ Input (pending)

**Actual Status**: 0% complete (0/30 components)

#### Evidence:
```bash
$ ls -la packages/ui-components/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 vitor 197609 0 Oct 12 22:12 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 vitor 197609 0 Oct 12 22:12 ..
# EMPTY DIRECTORY
```

```bash
$ find packages/ui-components -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts"
# NO RESULTS
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Button component** - Marked as "in progress (30%)" but **does not exist**
2. **SEMGChart** - Exists in `apps/mobile/src/components/` but is **NOT** part of the design system (mobile-specific component)
3. **packages/ui-components/** - Directory exists but is **completely empty**
4. **packages/theme/** - Directory **does not exist** at all

#### Impact:
- High - All future screens depend on design system components
- Development cannot proceed until foundation components exist

---

### 2. Authentication System - MAJOR DISCREPANCY ❌

**Documented Status**: 20% complete (1/5 screens, basic Login structure)

**Actual Status**: 0% complete (0/5 screens)

#### Evidence:
```bash
$ find apps/mobile/src/screens -name "*Login*" -o -name "*Auth*"
# NO RESULTS

$ find packages -name "*Auth*"
# NO RESULTS
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Login screen** - Marked as "🚧 Basic structure" but **does not exist**
2. **AuthContext** - Marked as "⏸️ Pending" but location `packages/contexts/` **does not exist**
3. **MockAuthService** - Documented but **never created**
4. No authentication-related files found anywhere in codebase

#### Impact:
- Critical - Users cannot login or access protected features
- Blocks all user management functionality

---

### 3. Test Infrastructure - COMPLETE ABSENCE ❌

**Documented Status**: 15% test coverage

**Actual Status**: 0% test coverage (no tests exist)

#### Evidence:
```bash
$ find . -name "*.test.tsx" -o -name "*.spec.tsx" -o -name "*.test.ts" | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
0
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. Zero test files in entire codebase
2. No testing framework configured (no Jest, no React Testing Library)
3. No test dependencies in package.json files
4. Storybook not configured (no .storybook directory)

#### Impact:
- Medium - Can be added later but increases technical debt
- Quality assurance is currently manual only

```bash
$ git log --since="3 weeks ago" --oneline | wc -l
13 commits

$ git log --since="3 weeks ago" --date=short --pretty=format:"%ad" | sort -u | wc -l

**Analysis**:
- Focus has been on streaming feature (which is complete ✅)
- Documentation commits exist but code implementation lags behind
- No commits for Button, Input, Login, or AuthContext components

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Documentation Didn't Match Reality

1. **Aspirational Documentation** - Docs written for planned work, not completed work
2. **Directory Creation ≠ Implementation** - Empty directories created but interpreted as "started"
3. **Lack of Verification** - No automated checks to verify doc accuracy
4. **Optimistic Estimates** - "In progress" used too liberally

### Recommended Preventions

1. **Verification Script** - Automated check that scans filesystem and validates doc claims
2. **Definition of Done** - Clear criteria for "complete" vs "in progress" vs "not started"
3. **Weekly Audits** - Regular reality checks against documentation
4. **Code-First Docs** - Update documentation AFTER code is committed, not before

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. ✅ **Update all documentation** - Reflect actual status (COMPLETED in this audit)
2. 🔴 **Create packages/ui-components/** - Setup directory structure
3. 🔴 **Extract design tokens** - Colors, Typography, Spacing from Figma
4. 🔴 **Implement Button component** - First atomic element
5. 🟡 **Setup Jest + Testing Library** - Test infrastructure

### Short-term Actions (Weeks 2-4)

1. Complete core components (Input, Dropdown, Password)
2. Implement AuthContext + MockAuthService
3. Build Login screen (mobile + desktop)
4. Add first round of tests (authentication flow)

### Medium-term Actions (Weeks 5-12)

1. Complete user management screens
2. Implement NPI and SNOMED features
3. Port all screens to desktop application
4. Achieve 80% test coverage
5. Setup Storybook documentation

### Process Improvements

1. **Weekly Progress Reviews** - Verify docs match code every Monday
2. **Automated Verification** - Script to check file existence
3. **Definition of Done** - Clear criteria before marking "complete"
4. **Git Commit Standards** - Link commits to documentation updates

## Conclusion

The IRIS project has a **solid foundation** with the streaming feature fully implemented. However, **documentation significantly overstated progress**, particularly for:

- Design system (claimed 10%, actual 0%)
- Authentication (claimed 20%, actual 0%)
- Test coverage (claimed 15%, actual 0%)

**The real progress is 12%, not 22%.**

Going forward, documentation must reflect **actual implementation**, not aspirational plans. This audit has corrected all documentation to match reality.

**Next Priority**: Build design system foundation (tokens + Button component).

**Audit Completed**: 2025-10-17
**Files Updated**: 3 documentation files corrected
**Status**: All documentation now reflects actual codebase ✅
